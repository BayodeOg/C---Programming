This repository is about my personal learning on C - Programming, consist of some C questions with solutions.
Note - Example 8-main.c talks about the modification of a variable from outside the function it is declared using a pointer
Example 9-main is talking about accessing the different elements of an array
Example 10-main talks about using the array name in your code and its value been the address of the first element of the array
Example 11-main talks about the array type decay which the array type gets automatically implicitly converted to pointer-to-element type
Example 12-main talks about the sizeof an array
